# ApparatusRetrieval

Lethal Company mod where employees are tasked to land on each moon, find the apparatus and get it back onto the ship.

The mod hasn't been playtested yet, so some things might not work, and some values probably need adjustment.

### All players need to have the mod installed and identically configured.
